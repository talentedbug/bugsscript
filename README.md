# Bug's Script

This is a collection of user scripts written by the Bug.

Currently the repository includes:

- Xiuren Enhanced: View member-only images on Xiuren, by hitting "=" on the viewer page. (**NSFW**)
- Auto Scroll: Does what you expect it to do by hitting "s".

## How to use them

You have to use a user script manager for your browser, such as Tampermonkey. Then you can import the Bug's scripts from raw content on GitHub.

More detailed guides are available with a few Google searches.
